  antialiased Font.

- added Teletext saving to Bitmap, VTX and plain Text.

- Fixed a wrong SID mapping in the Channel Editor.

- Renamed MHP Data/AIT Streams to Carousel Data/AIT Streams in the Channel Scan

- Added Audio Type Definition to the Channel Scan.

- Fixed ChannelScan didn't work with XP SP1.

- Added Multicast to Network streaming.

- bugfixed TS, PSI, Payload and Descriptor Parser. Shouldn't crash with invalid Data anymore.

- Added Scanning from TS-File to Channel Scan.

- Subtitles and DSMCC Streams are now identified. DSMCC Streams are passed to the DSMCC Parser. 
  Subtitles aren'n parsed yet.

- rewritten the Scanner and Filter. Stream Sources are now in an own Container which are streamed 
  to the Stream Source Filter. This will make Timeshifting and playing from TS Files easier to 
  implement.

- Added back the buggy MS Network Provider. It's still throwing a NULL Pointer Exception, but 
  this is now handled by the Filter and shouldn't lead to a crash. 

- Tuning is now by default using the MS TuningSpaces on the Network Provider. This fixes the 
  "cannot Tune to a Channel" Bug. Direct Tuning is still possible by enabling it in the 
  Channel Scanner (Note: MS TuningSpaces needs ~2 Seconds to Tune the Hardware to the new 
  Frequency, while Direct Tuning on the Hardware needs only half a second).

- Split Scanning from Editing in the Channel Scanner. It's now also possible to Scan from a 
  File or Network Stream.

- Added (another) workaround to find Channels where not all needed Data is being transmitted.

- Added a Simple Java Console Application that desscribes the internal Data Structure used for
  saving the EPG.

- Fixed Now and Next Events on the OSD. It should now really show the Current and Next Event and
  not some other Events from teh future. In case Now isn't available, Next will be shown.

- bugfixed recording with AC3 Streams.

- Added more Subtitle Informations to the Channel Editor.

  dynamic content update.

- added a Video Analyzer for Aspectratio detection (which is going to be used by the Subtitle 
  Filter).

- Subtitles Streams are now added to IAMStreamSelect. (NOTE: Subtitles are still not displayed yet!)

- added basic WMP Plugin for Channel selection.


v0.1.2 [2005-04-30]

- IDCDVBSource now Exports an internal Buffer Format for the EPG instead of an untyped 
  Pointer (which was a Pointer to a JvSimpleXML Instance). This improves the CPU Usage 
  when Parsing and Loading the EPG a lot.

- Fixed a few MHP Bugs. (thx to Peter Knecht)

- added DVB-C and DVB-S Support.

- Pins on the MPEG-2 Demultiplexer are now created on my own. This fixes a Bug with

  XP Pro.

- added Streaming TS Server.

- added option to write TS Stream to Disk.

- added Logging.

- bugfixed Tuning. The Filter uses now InterfaceLists for every BDA Interface instead
  of only one mapping.

  Renderer. This fixes an issue with the kX-Drivers and 5.1 Streams being played as a 
  2 Channel Stream.

- dropped MS Network Provider.

- dropped XML for EPG. Uses now an internal Binary Format.

- improved ChannelScan. This Version is out of the specs, but allows to parse 
  TS Streams with wrong TSID/ONID (like it's currently present in Milan/Italy).

- bugfixed Reference Counting.

- ChannelScan is now Multi Threaded.

- added OSD.

- added Recording.

- and so much other Bugfixes...
