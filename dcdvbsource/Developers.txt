This is a small walkthrough to the Tuning Plugins and the 
Data Plugins for the DC-DVB Source.

There are two different types of Plugins. One Type is for the
Tuning and receiving the Transport Stream. The other Type is 
for modifying the TS Data, controlling the Tuner Plugins and 
controlling the Filtergraph. All Plugins are based on the COM
Architecture. Why COM? Because it's flexible and can be easily
extended. You can have as many Control Windows (Property Pages)
as you want and if the API needs to be extended it can easily 
be done by adding another Interface Definition. Just check out
the Samples and you will see how easy it actually is :)

Ok, let's start with the Tuning Plugins. Basically, a Tuning
Plugin is taking a Tune Request and passing the Transport 
Stream to the "Application". In this case the Application is
the DC-DVB Source or the Channel Scanner. The Application 
may get/set other Values from/to the Plugin, like Signal 
Statistics or CI Commands. A Tuning Plugin must implement the 
IDCDVBTuningPlugin Interface. Developers should use the 
TDCDVBTuningPlugin Base Class instead of implementing the
Interface on their own. The IDCDVBTuningPlugin interface is only 
a List of IDCDVBTuningPluginDevice Interfaces, where each 
IDCDVBTuningPluginDevice implementation represents one Device.
(Again, Developers should't implement the IDCDVBTuningPluginDevice.
Use the TDCDVBTuningPluginDevice in this case)
For example, you are writing a Tuner Plugin for BDA Devices 
and you have a DVB-S and a DVB-T Device connected, then you
would create one IDCDVBTuningPlugin and add two IDCDVBTuningPluginDevice
implementations to it. If the user needs to setup additional
Parameters for the Device, you might want to add a Property
Page for the TDCDVBTuningPluginDevice. Property Pages can be
created from Forms or, to safe the Filesize, from Dialogs 
from Resources. Take a look into the Samples and you will 
see some Sample Code.

The Data Plugins are working similar like Tuning Plugins, except
that every Plugin contains only one Data Plugin and thus the List
Interface implementation isn't present. Data Plugins are 
responsible for modifying the Transport Stream, can map PID's 
on the Demultiplexer, have access to the Filtergraph and can 
access the IDCDVBTuningPluginDevice of a Tuning Plugin. The 
Samples shows how these Plugins are working.
